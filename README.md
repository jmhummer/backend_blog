This is a demo project that I created to practice my Node.js, Express, and EJS skills. It only runs locally at the moment so you will need to download all files and run the index.js file using Node.js. The file runs on port 3000 by default.

## How to Run:
1. Navigate to the repository containing all files that you have downloaded.
2. Enter command "node index.js". The message "Listening on port 3000." should print to the terminal.
3. Open your preferred browser and navigate to "localhost:3000". This should be the landing page for the blog.

All Node modules are included, however if any issues related to outdated modules occur, try reinstalling all modules used to check for updates:

npm i express body-parser ejs

Thank you for checking out my project!
